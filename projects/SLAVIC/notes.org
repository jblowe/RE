JEZERO in OCS doesn't reconstruct... so its an irregularity?

WHO KDO WHY

look at kridlo. see that the russian krydlo does not appear. possibly
analogous.

### This is indeed due to irregular sound change,


Syllable canon:

V?((CC?C?V)|((CC?C?Y)?(CC?C?y)))+

Y = strong yer
y = weak yer

--- supposed to encode Havl√≠k's law, i.e. where the position of the
    strong and weak yers are.

Flaw: This allows two adjacent weak yers, as in the string CyCy.


So we need to do this instead:

V?(CC?C?y)?((CC?C?V)|(((CC?C?Y)|(CC?C?V))(CC?C?y)))*

which disallows adjacent weak yers.

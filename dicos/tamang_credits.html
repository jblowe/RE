    <dd>The machine-readable dictionary used
        in this application is a work-in-progress by Martine Mazaudon (CNRS). The dictionary is the result of
        over 50 years of fieldwork in Nepal and careful lexicography. The original
        digital version is in
        <a href="http://www.montler.net/lexware/" target="_blank">Lexware</a> format,
        a computational dictionary tool written some 50 years ago.

    <dd>This "HTML only" version of the dictionary was created by a Python
        script written by John B. Lowe (UC Berkeley, CNRS) with the help with of ChatGPT. The CSS styling is
        based on Bootstrap 5, but the minimal CSS and Javascript needed to drive the application
        was extracted and is included inline.

<h4>About</h4>
<p>
  This is an early prototype of an online dictionary for the Tamang language of Nepal as spoken in the village of Risiangku (Lisankhu) in Sindhupalchok district, Bagmati province.
  It works on both mobile devices and desktop computers. It is built as a single standalone HTML page: it requires a web browser but does not require a
  connection to the internet.

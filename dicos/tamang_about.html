<h4>About</h4>
<p class="small">
    This is an early prototype of an online dictionary for the
    Tamang language of Nepal that works on both mobile devices
    and desktop computers. It is built as a single standalone
    HTML page: it requires a web browser but does not require a
    connection to the internet.

    Two facilities for searching the dictionary are provided:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Point-and-click searching using the ordered initial
        "letters" shown in the navigation bar.
    </li>
    <li>A "search box" that performs an instantaneous
        <i>free text</i> search of the entire dictionary.
    </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p class="small">
    The dictionary contains {entry_count} entries, and most have definitions
    in three languages: Nepali (in Devanagari with transliteration),
    French, and English.
